# bamtests customer kasm containers
*This repository contains the container source code for the [bamtests kasm registry](https://bamtests.github.io/kasm-registry/1.0/)*

There are two general goals with this repository:

1. Use open-source/telemetry free alternatives for software that is in the base kasm images (i.e. vscodium instead of code)
2. Add software that I happen to use (i.e. Obsidian.md), and if anyone wants to help I would be happy to add it to this.
